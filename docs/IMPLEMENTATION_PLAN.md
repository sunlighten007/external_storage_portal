# OTA Portal Implementation Plan

## Overview

This project already has a Next.js SaaS starter with authentication, teams (multi-tenancy), and RBAC. We'll adapt this foundation to build the OTA Image Management Portal described in the PRD.

**Current State:**
- âœ… Next.js 15 with App Router
- âœ… Postgres database with Drizzle ORM
- âœ… Authentication (JWT-based)
- âœ… Multi-tenancy (teams â†’ will become spaces)
- âœ… RBAC (roles already exist)
- âœ… Activity logging
- âœ… shadcn/ui components

**What We Need to Add:**
- ðŸ”¨ Adapt "teams" to "spaces" with S3 prefixes
- ðŸ”¨ AWS S3 integration
- ðŸ”¨ File upload table and functionality
- ðŸ”¨ Pre-signed URL generation
- ðŸ”¨ File upload/download UI
- ðŸ”¨ Optional metadata fields (version, changelog, MD5)

---

## Phase 1: Foundation & Database Schema (MVP Core)

**Goal:** Set up the database schema and S3 infrastructure without breaking existing functionality

### Task 1.1: Extend Database Schema for Spaces
**Files to modify:**
- `lib/db/schema.ts`

**Changes:**
1. Add fields to `teams` table (or rename to `spaces`):
   - `slug` VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL
   - `description` TEXT
   - `s3Prefix` VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL
   - `isActive` BOOLEAN DEFAULT true
2. Update types and exports
3. Keep existing `teamMembers` â†’ `spaceMembers` (or keep as is)

**Decision Point:** Should we rename `teams` to `spaces` or keep `teams` and add space-specific fields?
- **Recommendation:** Keep `teams` table name but add space-specific fields. Less breaking changes.

### Task 1.2: Create Uploads Table
**Files to create/modify:**
- `lib/db/schema.ts`

**New table:**
```typescript
uploads {
  id: serial PRIMARY KEY
  spaceId: integer (FK to teams.id)
  filename: varchar(255)
  s3Key: varchar(512) UNIQUE
  fileSize: bigint
  contentType: varchar(100)
  md5Hash: varchar(32)
  description: text
  changelog: text
  version: varchar(50)
  uploadedBy: integer (FK to users.id)
  uploadedAt: timestamp
  createdAt: timestamp
  updatedAt: timestamp
}
```

**Relations:**
- uploads â†’ teams (spaceId)
- uploads â†’ users (uploadedBy)

### Task 1.3: Generate and Run Migration
**Commands:**
```bash
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:migrate
```

**Verification:** Check that new columns/tables exist in database

### Task 1.4: Create Seed Data for Spaces
**Files to modify:**
- `lib/db/seed.ts`

**Add:**
1. Update existing team to have `slug: 'blaupunkt'` and `s3Prefix: 'uploads/blaupunkt'`
2. Set `isActive: true`
3. Add description

**Test:** Run `pnpm db:seed` and verify data

   - Before Phase 14 (Production)

4. **Git Strategy**
   - Create feature branch for each phase
   - Create PR for each phase
   - Use descriptive commit messages
   - Tag releases (v0.1-mvp, v0.2-admin, etc.)

5. **Documentation**
   - Document as you build
   - Update README with setup instructions
   - Keep API docs updated
   - Add inline code comments for complex logic

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **Large file uploads (5GB)**
   - Mitigation: Use chunked uploads, test early
   - Fallback: Reduce max file size

2. **S3 costs**
   - Mitigation: Set up cost alerts
   - Monitor: Storage usage dashboard

3. **Database performance with many files**
   - Mitigation: Proper indexing, pagination
   - Monitor: Query performance

4. **Pre-signed URL expiration**
   - Mitigation: Handle gracefully, allow retry
   - Extend: Allow custom expiration times

### Security Risks

1. **S3 credential exposure**
   - Mitigation: Server-side only, never in client
   - Verify: Security audit

2. **Space access bypass**
   - Mitigation: Check access on every request
   - Test: Comprehensive access control tests

3. **Malicious file uploads**
   - Mitigation: File type validation, size limits
   - Consider: Virus scanning (future)

### Business Risks

1. **User confusion with spaces**
   - Mitigation: Clear UX, good documentation
   - Provide: User onboarding

2. **Data loss**
   - Mitigation: S3 versioning, database backups
   - Test: Recovery procedures

---

## Notes

- The existing codebase gives us a huge head start
- Most authentication and RBAC is already done
- We're essentially adapting "teams" to "spaces" and adding file management
- Focus on getting MVP working first, then add polish
- Test security and access control thoroughly
- Document as you go for easier maintenance
