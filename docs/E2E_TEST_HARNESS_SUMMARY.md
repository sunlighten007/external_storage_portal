# E2E Test Harness Summary

## Overview

I've successfully created a comprehensive End-to-End (E2E) test harness for your OTA Image Management Portal using Playwright. This test suite ensures both frontend and backend functionality work correctly together in a real browser environment.

## What Was Created

### 1. Test Infrastructure
- **Playwright Configuration** (`playwright.config.ts`)
- **Global Setup/Teardown** (`tests/global-setup.ts`, `tests/global-teardown.ts`)
- **Test Utilities** (`tests/utils/`)
- **Test Runner Script** (`scripts/test-runner.sh`)
- **CI/CD Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml`)

### 2. Test Suites
- **Authentication Tests** (`auth.spec.ts`) - Login, logout, session management
- **Dashboard Tests** (`dashboard.spec.ts`) - Navigation, data display, responsive design
- **Spaces Management Tests** (`spaces.spec.ts`) - File management, upload/download
- **File Upload Tests** (`file-upload.spec.ts`) - Various file types, progress tracking
- **API Integration Tests** (`api-integration.spec.ts`) - Backend API testing
- **Smoke Tests** (`smoke.spec.ts`) - Basic application health checks

### 3. Test Utilities
- **AuthHelper** - Authentication operations
- **FileHelper** - File upload/download operations
- **Test Data** - Consistent test data management

### 4. Documentation
- **Comprehensive Testing Guide** (`docs/TESTING.md`)
- **Updated README** with testing instructions
- **Test Documentation** (`tests/README.md`)

## Key Features

npx playwright test auth.spec.ts

# Run for specific browser
npx playwright test --project=chromium

# Debug mode
npm run test:debug
```

### Test Runner Script
```bash
# Make executable
chmod +x scripts/test-runner.sh

# Run all tests
./scripts/test-runner.sh

# Run with options
./scripts/test-runner.sh --ui --browser chromium
```
